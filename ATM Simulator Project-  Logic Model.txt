ATM Simulator Project-  Logic/ Models:-

The detailed breakdown of the logic and models for the ATM simulator project:

1.ATM Class:

Create an ATM class to encapsulate the ATM's functionality.

class ATM:
    def _init_(self, balance, pin):
        self.balance = balance
        self.pin = pin

Initialize the ATM with a starting balance and a PIN.

2.Check Balance

Create a method in the ATM class to check the account balance.

    def check_balance(self):
        return self.balance

3.Deposit:

Implement a method to handle deposits and update the account balance.

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        return f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}"

4.Withdraw:

Create a method to handle withdrawals and ensure the account has sufficient funds.

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            return f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}"
        else:
            return "Insufficient balance."

5.Main Loop:

In the main part of the script, initialize the ATM object and start a loop to present options to the user.

pin = input("Enter your PIN: ")
atm = ATM(1000, pin)  # Starting balance is $1000

while True:

6.Menu Options:

Display a menu of options to the user and get their choice.


    print("\nOptions:")
    print("1. Check Balance")
    print("2. Deposit")
    print("3. Withdraw")
    print("4. Exit")
    option = input("Select an option (1/2/3/4): ")

7.Option Handling:

Based on the user's choice, call the corresponding methods in the ATM class and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

    if option == "1":
        print("Balance: $", atm.check_balance())
    elif option == "2":
        amount = float(input("Enter the deposit amount: $"))
        print(atm.deposit(amount))
    elif option == "3":
        amount = float(input("Enter the withdrawal amount: $"))
        print(atm.withdraw(amount))
    elif option == "4":
        print("Exiting. Thank you!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid option. Please select 1, 2, 3, or 4.")

This logic and model represent a basic ATM simulator in Python. Users can enter their PIN, check their balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit. It handles invalid options and provides feedback accordingly.
